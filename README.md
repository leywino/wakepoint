# WakePoint ⏰🗺️

**Never miss your stop again. Even when you're fast asleep.**

## 🚀 About WakePoint

WakePoint is a location-based alarm app designed especially for people who travel and tend to fall asleep during their journey. The idea was born out of a personal experience — while working in Kochi, I used to travel home by bus every couple of weeks. These were usually overnight journeys, and I’d often sleep during the ride. One night, I slept through my stop and ended up far from my hometown. That moment sparked the idea for WakePoint.
